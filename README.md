# Anrcy - Another Neovim Rest Client... Yo

## About

Another REST client plugin for Neovim that nobody asked for.

Essentially just a plugin for turning lua tables into curl commands.
Feature wise, Anrcy is pretty minimal and it is probably a bit clunky. Not all curl
features and flags are properly implemented but it suits my needs.

<br>

## But why?

This plugin was developed for personal use and not necessarily to fix a problem that
hasn't been fixed already. There are plenty of better plugins out there. 
For me, the other plugins were overkill and I felt that this would be a fun challenge.

When creating this I had a few goals in mind: 

- lua object structure that is easy to use in neovim
- quickly and easily "sketch" out a request anywhere
- easily create tests that run against the response data
- display the response and test results in a buffer


<br>
<br>


## Installation

Lazy:

```lua
{
    "thisiskyle/anrcy",
    opts = {},
}
```


<br>
<br>


## Configuration

```lua
opts = {
    -- (optional) this function will be run after the response data is added to the new buffer useful for formatting the response
    -- NOTE: this will be overidden by anrcy.Job.after if one is set
    --@type fun()?
    global_after = function() end,
},
```


<br>
<br>


## Usage

Anrcy uses lua tables to build curl commands. 
You use neovim to visually select the table(s) and run `:Anrcy` 

The response data, test results, and anything else returned from the http call will 
be displayed in its own buffer.

<i>NOTE: Selected text is wrapped in an array internally. So to run multiple jobs
they should be separated by a comma.<i>

<br>
<br>

### Commands 

|Command|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Anrcy|Run the currently selected jobs|
|AnrcyRepeat|Repeat the last job that was run|
|AnrcyBookmark|Save the current visually selected jobs|
|AnrcyBookmarkRun|Run the currently bookmarked jobs|
|AnrcyShowCurl|Display the curl commands created by the current visually selected jobs (does not run anything)|
|AnrcyTemplate|Insert a job template at the cursor location|
|AnrcyClear|Clear any currently running and cached jobs|

<br>
<br>

### Job Template

```lua
---@type anrcy.Job
{ 
    --- (optional) name of the job, will be used to name the response buffer
    ---@type string
    name = "", 

    --- (optional) show the curl command that is created from this job
    --- in the results buffer
    ---@type boolean
    show_cmd = false, 

    --- (required) request type  [ "GET", "POST" ]
    ---@type string
    type = "",

    --- (required) request url
    ---@type string
    url = "",

    --- (optional) array of header strings
    ---@type string[]
    headers = { },

    --- (optional) request body / url params
    ---@type anrcy.RequestData[]
    data = {

        --- (optional) in the curl command, add '--data-urlencode' prefix before each data string in the list
        ---@type string[]
        urlencode = {}, 

        --- (optional) in the curl command, add '--data-raw' prefix before the data
        ---@type string[]
        raw = {}, 

        --- (optional) encodes the lua table as json and will add '--data' prefix before 
        --- the data in the curl command
        ---@type table
        lua = {},

        --- (optional) in the curl command, add '--data' prefix before the string 
        ---@type string
        standard = {},

        --- (optional) in the curl command, add '--data-binary' prefix before the string 
        ---@type string
        binary = {},

    },

    --- (optional) array of additional curl arguments as strings
    ---@type string[]
    additional_args = {},

    --- (optional) runs after the response is loaded into the buffer, used for formatting
    ---@type fun(data: anrcy.ResponseData)
    after = nil,

    --- (optional) runs last, runs tests against the reponse data
    ---@type fun(data: anrcy.ResponseData): anrcy.TestResult[]
    test = nil,
},
```

```lua

```lua

    name = "ditto", 
    type = "GET", 
    url = "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto", 
    headers = {

    }, 
    additional_args = {  
        "-i"
